This project which focuses on building a 3D Earth Map data that is generated using AI that will be managed to teach by the team. The basic intuition we had at first was, wouldn't it be awesome if the map apps we have currently can tell more than just 2D images, if it gave us awareness of the objects that are nearby your location and give you spatial awareness of the location you desire. This idea was compelling to me and thanks the Python's vast amount of resources and libraries, We rolled up my sleaves and started hitting those keys.
